## Genome assembly pipeline for D. pseudoobscura (ST) and D. persimilis (M40).
This is a genome assembly pipeline used (from paper) for Drosophila pseudoobscura (ST) and Drosophila persimilis (M40).
This pipeline implements a hybrid assembly using Illumina short reads and PacBio CLR reads.

# Step 1.
Generation of a PacBio-only assembly using CLR reads. This step was
